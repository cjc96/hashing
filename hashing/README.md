# Project for Data Structure CS261P

## Overview

In this project you are to implement several different hashing algorithms perform an empirical comparative analysis of their running times. The hashing algorithms to be implemented are:

1. linear hashing
2. chained hashing,
3. cuckoo hashing, and
4. at least one additional hash table algorithm of your choice.

## Questions

For the empirical analysis, run the algorithms on a variety of test cases to determine the relative efficiencies of the algorithms as functions of various parameters, such as the number of elements and the load factor. How do your results compare with theoretical predictions of worst-case and amortized-time? You are encouraged to consider other factors as well. For example, if you generate your test cases randomly, you how do your choices of probability distribution and the distribution parameters affect your results?
